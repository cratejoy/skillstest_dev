## Scenario

I'm a non technical merchant and I've purchased 3 hours of design help from Cratejoy Premier. I have my website up but it's not quite there yet.

## Request

I would like to add an image gallery showing off information about my subscription. I really like the one I found on this wordpress theme: http://demo.fabthemes.com/Orion/

Can you add an image gallery my website? I've attached the six images I want in my image gallery in order.

Please put it in a new section on my homepage below the banner but above the "What is BookSea?" section.

## Instructions

You'll need to complete the above tweaks request.

You can run the server by doing:

```
make run
```

You can view the webpage in your browser at http://localhost:5000

Save and commit your changes to your version of the repository.

The "attached" assets are contained in the assets directory.

If something isn't working or you encounter errors please don't struggle with it, just e-mail Amir - it's likely a bug in the test not a fault of your own.
